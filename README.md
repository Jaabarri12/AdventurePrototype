A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Island1, Island2, Scene1, Cave.
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro, GoodEnding, Bad Ending
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: The method is fadeItem and basically it just fades a lot of items after something happens.
    - Enhancement 2: The second method is Shake and basically shakes objects when the user touches things.

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Island1, Island2, Scene1, Cave
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: The Lock and the rock they fade and shake when you touch em(Island1)
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: The boat and the water they have some messages that get displayed(Scene1)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: The monkey and the Tree they give you items when you click down(Island1 and Island2)
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: The lock and the snake they shake and fade when touched at different times(Island2 and Island1)

Asset sources:
- (For each image/audio/video asset used, describe how it was created. What tool did you use to create it? Was it based on another work? If so, how did you change it, and where can we learn more about the original work for comparison? Use [Markdown link syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links).)

- Basically almost all the drawings I drew myself using procreate on my ipad just looking at typical ideas online to mash things together not really copying though
